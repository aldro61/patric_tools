Note: The package is currently broken due to a restructuration of the FTP server. Will fix this ASAP. (2018-01-29)

# PATRIC tools
A Python package to interact with the PATRIC database (https://www.patricbrc.org)

## Notes

* This package is highly dependant on the structure of the FTP directories at PATRIC. If the structure changes, parts of the code may need to be updated.

## Disclaimer
This is not an official tool of the PATRIC database. It is a package that I use for my personal interaction with the database.
